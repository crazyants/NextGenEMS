# NextGenEMS

## Brief Overview
-	Developed from the ground up a realtime critical-care patient tracking/management software designed specifically for EMTs and paramedics in the field.
-	Advanced voice recognition helps reduce the burden of manually writing/typing extensive patient info and continuously documenting vital signs in time-critical situations.
-	Support for synchronizing full patient and EMT statuses across multiple medical stations during large-scale events or incident response operations.
-	Extensive statistical analysis and minute-by-minute rewind to improve future response protocols and personnel training. 



## NextGenEMS Features (Work In Progress)
-	**Advanced Voice Recognition:** Advanced voice recognition and natural language process allow EMTs and Paramedics to update patient information and vitals by voice. Flexible processing algorithms allow multiple vital signs or patient info fields to be spoken in natural sentences and in any order. 
-	**Realtime Synchronization:** Supports synchronizing full patient and EMT statuses across multiple medical stations during large scale events or incident response operations.
-	**High-Visibility Interface:** Designed for specifically for tablets, the interface clearly displays the most important information and alerts in realtime.
-	**Manage Multiple Patients & Medical Centers Simultaneously:** Streamlined visual interface allows supervisors to monitor multiple medical stations across large scale events such as festivals, marathons, protests or sporting events. Synchronized data includes full patient info, vital signs, emergency transport requests, and EMS personnel availability. Data is synchronized in real-time across all medical stations to efficiently allocate personnel and resources in real-time. 
-	**Clear, Streamlined Visual Interface:** clearly labeled tiles on the visual interface will change color once the spoken information is processed and validated, allowing the providers to clearly see what additional info is still required. If the software has trouble interpreting a command, the relevant tile will be flagged as yellow to indicate that the information should be spoken again to ensure accuracy.
-	**Intelligent Vital Sign Monitoring:** Once all required vital signs are updated, the software will automatically flag vitals that fall outside normal ranges with color codes indicating severity. Patient status (critical, stable, etc.) will be recommended by the software according to local protocols 
-	**Versatile Interface for Single or Multi-Patient Scenarios:** Three separate operating modes/interfaces for single patient scenarios, multi patient scenarios as a medical provider and multi patient scenario as a manager.
-	**Dynamic Reminders and Notifications:** Depending on patient status, the software will automatically display an visual & audio reminder when new vitals must be taken.
-	**Dual-Mode Documentation to Ensure Integrity:** Each time patient vitals are updated, or information is provided, the software will save a high-quality, distortion-filtered copy of the original voice command (If this setting is enabled) and dynamically link this audio clip to the vitals entry / timestamp. In case there is any discrepancy later on as to if the documentation is accurate, the original audio clip can be replayed for verification. 
Keep the Focus on Patient Care: Eliminate the burden of manually writing/typing extensive patient info and continuously documenting vital signs in time-critical situations
-	**Bluetooth Device Integration:** Bluetooth integration with a specialized clip on microphone / speaker helps eliminate background noise
-	**Statistical Analysis:** Post-scenario analysis includes average number and duration of patient contacts, ratio of patient treatment & discharge vs emergency transport requests, patient demographics, patient volume at any given time, most common causes for admission as well as support for filtering statistics by timeframe.
-	**Minute-By-Minute Scenario Review:** Improve protocols, resource allocation and personnel training by reviewing every detail of an event or incident response, minute by minute.
-	**EMS Personnel Management:** Store info pertaining to active EMS personnel including license details, certification status, high-resolution photo, previous and current patients, schedule and more.
-	**Automatic License Lookups:** Automatically validate medical licenses through national and local registries to ensure that all personnel are in good standing and maintain active licenses prior to events. 
-	**Automated, Real-Time guidance for Treatment Procedures & Medication Protocols:** The software can recognize and answer certain types of verbal questions, such as confirming medication & dose prior to administering, to detect potentially dangerous drug interactions, overlooked allergic reactions, and other potential human-error oversights. (These responses can be modified by the local MD to comply with local protocols)
-	**Quickly Access Info on Unknown Medications or Drugs:** If unsure about information pertaining to a particular medication or substance, a simple voice command can pull up the requested info about the medication or drug (This info can be set and validated according to local protocols)
